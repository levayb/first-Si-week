# Fibonacci
# Story
# Your boss is obsessed with mathematics and he likes 
# challenging you with math exercises. This week, 
# he walks around the office and asks for specific Fibonacci numbers 
# from everyone in your department. To trick him, 
# you decided to write a magical program (python script) 
# that calculates some of them and share it with your colleagues, 
# so everyone can answer immediately. Hopefully, 
# he stops his weird bullying after he sees that all the people in his office know these numbers :)

# Description
# Write a script that prints out the first 30 
# numbers of the Fibonacci sequence to the standard output.

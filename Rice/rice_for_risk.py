Write a python script, that generates 5 numbers between 
1 and 6 and prints them in a meaningful way
for the game. Sort the results for the attacker and for the defender,
so make roll pairs, like in this image:

In a dice pair, there are the following rules:

When the attacker's die value is larger: Attacker wins (1 defender unit dies)
When the 2 dice value is tie: Defender wins (1 attacker unit dies)
When the defender's die value is larger: Defender wins (1 attacker unit dies)

Calculate the Outcome of the rolls:

Add 2 questions and inputs, where the users can set how many attackers and
defenders play in the current roll.
Limit the attackers to only type 1, 2 or 3, and the defender to type only 1 or 2.

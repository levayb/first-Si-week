'''
In English, the present participle is formed by adding the suffix -ing to the infinite form: go -> going.

A simple set of heuristic rules can be given as follows:
If the verb ends in e, drop the e and add -ing (if not exception: be, see, flee, knee, etc.)
If the verb ends in ie, replace ie with y and add -ing
For words consisting of consonant-vowel-consonant, double the final letter before adding -ing
By default just add -ing
Write the script which takes infinitive verbs separated by one space as the command
line arguments and displays their present participle form in separated lines.
